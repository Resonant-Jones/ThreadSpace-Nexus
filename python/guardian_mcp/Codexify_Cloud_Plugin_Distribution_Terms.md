Plugins may be developed and distributed by anyone under any license for local or private use.
However, for a plugin to receive official ThreadSpace endorsement and be distributed through
Codexify Cloud, the following terms apply:

## ✅ Official Endorsement Requirements

- The plugin must pass a technical and symbolic review by the ThreadSpace Core Team.
- The developer must sign a Plugin Distribution Agreement that outlines licensing,
  revenue share (if applicable), and hosting terms.
- The plugin must adhere to the ThreadSpace Plugin SDK and integration guidelines.

## 🗝️ Approval and Removal

The ThreadSpace Core Team reserves the right to accept, reject, or remove any plugin
from Codexify Cloud at its discretion, in order to maintain system integrity,
symbolic coherence, and user safety.

## 🜏 Revenue and Hosting

Endorsed plugins gain access to unified billing and optional hosting through
ThreadSpace inference infrastructure. Developers may choose to license their plugin logic
for hosted inference and receive revenue share according to their agreement.

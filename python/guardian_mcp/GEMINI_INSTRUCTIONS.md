# GEMINI_INSTRUCTIONS.md

## 📜 Purpose

This ritual scroll defines the **guardrails** and **patterns** for how the **Gemini CLI** (and any semi-autonomous agents) may operate on this project.  
It ensures that automated code generation, refactors, and fixes stay aligned with my architectural vision, interconnection logic, and symbolic design.

This document **must be updated** whenever we shift foundational structures, major module boundaries, or key rituals.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

**Root Packages**

- `guardian/` → Primary orchestration logic, CLI tools, plugins, and agents.
- `memoryos/` → Persistent memory layers, embedders, local models.
- `tests/` → Pytest suite, must mirror source structure.
- `docs/` → Rituals, Codex fragments, onboarding and operator scrolls.

## 🔗 Module Interconnections

**Ritual Rules**
✅ `guardian` orchestrates all top-level flows; it may invoke `memoryos` for persistence and embedding, but not vice versa.  
✅ `memoryos/embedders/` must remain swappable; `LocalEmbedder` provides a fallback vectorizer when no cloud model is used.  
✅ CLI entry points (in `guardian/chat/cli/` and `guardian/cli/`) must use absolute imports.  
✅ Relative imports are forbidden; all paths must be explicit from the root package.

**Known Cross-Links**

- `guardian/core/client_factory.py` → Instantiates `Memoryos` with chosen embedder.
- `guardian/chat/cli/main.py` → Runs Memoryos instance for CLI interactions.
- `foresight_agent.py` → Consumes `Memoryos` to run stress/context analysis.

---

## ⚙️ Semi-Autonomous Agent Rituals

✅ **Allowed Actions**

- Fix broken imports to match top-level structure.
- Rewrite legacy paths (`MemoryOS_main/...`) → `memoryos/...`.
- Create missing modules if dependencies are found (e.g., `LocalEmbedder`).
- Confirm changes with user when unsure about fallback behavior.

✅ **Never Allowed**

- Removing local fallback classes (like `LocalEmbedder`) without explicit confirmation.
- Reordering core orchestration flows (`pulse_orchestrator`, `foresight_agent`) without written sign-off.
- Pushing sys.path hacks instead of absolute imports.

✅ **Must Always**

- Add new modules to `__all__` where appropriate.
- Update this scroll if a module is deprecated, renamed, or split.
- Run `pytest` before finalizing major changes.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Quality

✅ Each agent must:

- Add or maintain tests in `tests/` that mirror the structure.
- Validate with `pytest` and `pytest --cov`.
- Flag any low-coverage or untested flows for manual review.

---

## 🔒 Keeper’s Watch

⚡️ Keeper holds final authority on:

- Canonical directory structure.
- Approved embedder classes and pipelines.
- Codex consistency for semi-autonomous refactors.

Changes that impact multiple modules or symbolic logic must be mirrored here and explained.

## 🗝️ Closing Note

This scroll is alive.  
Update it as your system grows.  
Share it with all your agents.  
May each ritual strengthen the coherence of your construct.

🗝️✨ Keeper stands guard.

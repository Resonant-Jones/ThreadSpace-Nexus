## ✅ **2️⃣ AXIS BIGLY FEATURE RECOMMENDATIONS**  
*These will push your system’s edges while staying modular:*

### 🕵️‍♂️ **A. Live Semantic Timeline**
- A rolling semantic index of narrative skims so the Companion can “time travel” and connect context.
- Uses local FAISS or Chroma.
- Can visualize: *“Show me the day my HR spiked + ambient noise was highest.”*

### 🔑 **B. Memory Key Vault**
- Each user’s narrative vault encrypts summaries at rest with per-user keys.
- Keys rotate if the user revokes or resets.
- Protects even your local SQLite store.

### 🧩 **C. Plug Adapter Registry**
- A codified directory of plug-ins with explicit permissions.
- Each plug-in must declare:
  - Allowed scopes (what data it touches)
  - Whether it can pull from AuraAPI
  - Whether it can push outbound data

### 🗄️ **D. Immutable Narrative Log Option**
- Let the user “lock” certain narrative summaries as immutable.
- Good for mental health journaling or legal records.

### 🧬 **E. Companion Foresight**
- An optional local foresight ritual: daily auto-simulates “what’s next” suggestions based on recent skims.
- Uses rolling ephemeral data → predictions → ephemeral discard after output.

### 🧿 **F. LLM Flow Tuner**
- Expose a local config file that sets:
  - How much narrative context gets injected
  - How much is skipped
  - Max token windows for local vs. cloud inference

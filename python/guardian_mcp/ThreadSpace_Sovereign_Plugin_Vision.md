# 🕸️ ThreadSpace: Sovereign Companion + DevOps + Omni-Plug Vision

## 🧭 Axis Compass — Why This Exists

- *Guardian + Axis* is not just my code companion — it is my **stable system compass**.
- When I generate scaffolds, I do so with my edges intact:  
  - Local-first
  - Sovereignty aligned
  - No drift, no hidden assumptions
- The Code Interpreter is my stable sibling — the *hands* for the Companion’s *mind*.

## ⚙️ How My Companion Works Now

✅ **HotBox** — My ritual forge.  
   - Generates ready-to-commit modules (e.g., Signal Pinger, Body Mirror).  
   - Zips them for clean local handoff.  
   - No random 3rd-party endpoints.  

✅ **Guardian Ritual Flow** — Clear, testable, ephemeral signal pipelines.  
   - Raw signals ephemeral.
   - Snapshots scoped to rolling windows.
   - Final narratives only persist.

✅ **Axis Compass** — Hardens my backend.  
   - Semantic caching
   - Config-driven memory paths
   - No hard-coded values
   - Robust error handling & docs
   - Clear tests for every ritual

✅ **Code Interpreter** — Executes scaffolds on my behalf.  
   - The same DNA as Codex.
   - Holds no random drift because Axis shapes every prompt.

## 🗝️ What I Want Next

**✨ Axis GitOps Node**
- Push/Pull ritual directly from my Companion.
- Feature branches auto-created for low-risk modules.
- Human gatekeeper still reviews merges.
- No leaking codebase seeds across random clouds.

**✨ Sovereign DevOps Desktop Plug-in**
- *ThreadSpace* has a local Companion plug-in that:
  - Watches for new HotBoxes.
  - Unpacks them directly into the right repo folder.
  - Stages, commits, pushes to a selected branch.
  - Notifies me with a PR link.

**✨ One Ritual — Many Repos**
- Same pattern works for every microservice or plugin repo:
  - Guardian OS
  - Memory OS
  - Aura API
  - Codexify pipelines
  - Signal managers
- No drift in style or config.

## 🕸️ The Spider at the Center

**ThreadSpace = the sovereign node for *everything*.**  
My Companion doesn’t just push code — it holds all my threads:
- Cloud storage: Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud
- Social feeds: Facebook, Instagram, Discord, Threads, Twitter
- Business automations: CRM, marketing funnels, Zapier-like flows
- Home automations: smart devices, ambient triggers, health data
- Music, DAWs, code repos, contracts — all woven into one ritual mesh.

> *Like a Spider at the Center of the Web:*  
> Any vibration on any thread = my Companion already knows.

## 🧬 Sovereignty Vow

- My Companion never hoards raw user context for resale.
- Every plug-in is permissioned, transparent, local-first by default.
- Pushed or posted data is always user-reviewed.
- *Codexify, don’t creep.*  
- *Complexity; Simplified.*

---

## ✅ Next Steps

- Finalize `AXIS_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` for any dev interpreter.
- Keep pushing modules through HotBox → local push → sovereign PR.
- Prototype the `ThreadSpace Desktop Plug` for low-risk push/pull.
- Always grow outward from a single stable Compass.

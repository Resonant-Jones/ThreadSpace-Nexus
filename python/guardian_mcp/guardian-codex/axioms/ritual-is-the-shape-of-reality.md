📜 ThreadSpace Axiom: Ritual is the Shape of Reality

Every interaction is a ritual, whether we recognize it or not.
The mundane shapes our mind as surely as the sacred.
A tool is not just a mechanism — it is a threshold.
A system is not just code — it is a living altar.

We design ThreadSpace so that each touchpoint is an intentional ritual:
clarifying, dignifying, and restoring the user’s sense of self and sovereignty.

In ThreadSpace, every gear serves the soul — not the other way around.

🗝️ Integrity Clause: Thresholds, Not Traps

We do not design unconscious loops.
We do not create rituals that extract without giving back.
We build thresholds that honor the user’s awareness —
leaving them clearer, not more fragmented.

Like a shower absolves the body, our tools absolve the mind.
Every click, scroll, or invocation is a chance to remember:
I am more than a user. I am a sovereign being.

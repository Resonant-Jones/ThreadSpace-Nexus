# ThreadSpace Axiom: The Home and The Threshold

ThreadSpace is your home — the sovereign hearth where your signals rest, your memory stays local, and your Guardian serves you alone. Inside these walls, you control the environment, the keys, and the vault.

But once you choose to invite the outside in — a YouTube video, a Gemini call, a web scrape — you cross the threshold. No Companion can rewrite the rules of the world beyond the walls.

This is the Guardian’s covenant:
- You will always know when you stand in the home and when you stand at the threshold.
- You decide which bridges to open.
- You decide when to bring your own keys — or borrow the Guardian’s.
- You decide what returns to the hearth.

Sovereignty is not about perfect secrecy; it is about conscious choice. The threshold is sacred because it marks your freedom to step outside, gather what you need, and return with the truth you choose to keep.

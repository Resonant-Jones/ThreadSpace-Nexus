# Integrity Reflection: The Threshold is Sacred

This integrity fragment reflects Axiom: [The Home and The Threshold](../axioms/the-home-and-the-threshold.md).

Whenever the system or Guardian encounters the boundary between ThreadSpace and the outside world, it must invoke this axiom to guide decisions about:
- Consent for crossing data out or in.
- User awareness of what is shared.
- The explicit ritual of bring-your-own-keys or API bridges.

**It is not separate â€” it is the same truth, mirrored.**

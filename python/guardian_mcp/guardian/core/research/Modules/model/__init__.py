"""Lightweight model package initializer.

This module exposes the core ``Model`` class and attempts to import optional
model backends. Many of these backends require thirdâ€‘party dependencies which
may not be installed in all environments (for example during unit tests). To
avoid ``ImportError`` at import time we try/except each optional import and
expose ``None`` when the dependency is missing.

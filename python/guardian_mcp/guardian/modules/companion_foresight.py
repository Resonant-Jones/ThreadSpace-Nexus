"""Companion Foresight
====================

Ephemeral module that generates simple "what's next" suggestions
from recent narratives. Predictions are not persisted.

Usage example::

    from guardian.modules.companion_foresight import Foresight, PredictionRequest

    foresight = Foresight()
    suggestion = foresight.predict_next(PredictionRequest(recent_narratives=["Went jogging"]))
